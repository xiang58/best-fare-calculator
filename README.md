##Best Fare Calculator V1.1
This project determines the best fare option for the user who visits large cities and plan to use its transit system.

####Release Notes
- The fare options were hard-coded, with the Pay-Per-Ride fare being $2.75; 7-day Unlimited Rides being $33.00; and 30-day Unlimited Rides being $127.00. [See MTA official website here for more information](https://new.mta.info/fares-and-tolls/subway-bus-and-staten-island-railway).
- Hashmap has been adopted to store the fare options, replacing array list.
- User can now enter on the command line the number of days visiting and the number of expected rides.
