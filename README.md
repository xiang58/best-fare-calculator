## Best Fare Calculator V1.3 (2020-2-28)
This project determines the best fare option for the user who visits large cities and plan to use its transit system.
Currently, the city is set to NYC. The default transit system is MTA. The fare options were hard-coded, with the Pay-Per-Ride fare being $2.75; 7-day Unlimited Rides being $33.00; and 30-day Unlimited Rides being $127.00. [See MTA official website here for more information](https://new.mta.info/fares-and-tolls/subway-bus-and-staten-island-railway).
